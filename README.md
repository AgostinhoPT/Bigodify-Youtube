## Notes

- This extension should be compatible with any Firefox / Chromium based browser.
- This extension was inspired by **[Unnecessary Inventions][UI YouTube]** and his **[Website][UI Website]**.
- This extension is unofficial and not affiliated with MrBeast or YouTube.

## Microsoft Edge <a id="microsoftedge"></a>

Microsoft Edge support has been ended, and the extension has been delisted. This is because Edge is consistently the slowest at reviewing extensions, constantly rejects my submissions with vague reasons why, and are allround terrible. Download the Chrome version instead.

## ðŸŒ± Eco-friendly mode, and AllColibri

With our partnership with AllColibri (also known as Impact Hero or Colibri Hero), you can now offset carbon and help the environment at no cost while using the extension and browsing the web. This feature is entirely optional (opt-in) and the extension will function without it. The code that enables this is not in this repository, as by contract, I am not allowed to redistribute their SDK, and adding it to the repo would make it so every fork would also include the SDK. **However**, the SDK can still be inspected through downloading the extension and manually inspecting it. Nothing is obfuscated, the code should be plain readable.

Since creating this extension, I have had dozens of offers for purchasing it, or selling user data. I have declined every single one. I would not have partnered with AllColibri if I did not trust them.
